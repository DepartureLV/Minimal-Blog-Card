# Minimal Blog Card

challenge by: [devchallenges](https://devchallenges.io/)

I appreciate the tools provided by devchallenges. they show you a every typo in the challenge including each font size (px, rem), the colors in the challenge (give all, but you need to guess what is right). Also the spacing guide, I very love it because I can dev quicker by not guessing what the right gap, padding, and margin.
